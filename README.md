# Hello-World
This repository is simply for practicing the GitHub flow!
Hello, my name is Jadyn Reha. I am a senior at the University of Iowa with plans of graduating with a bachelor's degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems (BAIS). I have graduated from the Des Moines Area Community College with an associates degree in Liberal Arts just about two years prior.
